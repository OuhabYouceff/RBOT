# RBOT

RBOT is a Python-based project developed by Youcef Ouhab, a computer science student at L'École supérieure privée d'ingénierie et de technologie in Tunisia. While specific details about the project's functionality are not provided, the repository structure suggests it may involve data processing or verification tasks.

## Project Structure

* **`app/`**: Contains the main application code.
* **`data/`**: Holds data files used or generated by the application.
* **`.env`**: Environment variables for configuration settings.
* **`.DS_Store`**: macOS system file (can be ignored or added to `.gitignore`).
* **`init_data.py`**: Script for initializing or preprocessing data.
* **`verify.py`**: Script potentially used for data verification or validation.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configuration variables as needed by the application.
